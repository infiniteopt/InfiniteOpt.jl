# [Results](@id result_docs)
A guide for querying optimized `InfiniteOpt` models. See the respective 
[technical manual](@ref result_manual) for more details.

## Overview
So far we have covered defining, transforming, and optimizing `InfiniteModel`s. 
Now comes the point to extract information from our optimized model. This is done 
following extended versions of `JuMP`s querying functions in combination with 
the mapping information stored in the optimizer model. Thus, this page will 
walk through the use of these result query functions.

## Basic Usage
Let's revisit the example from the optimization page to get us started:
```jldoctest results
julia> using InfiniteOpt, Ipopt;

julia> model = InfiniteModel(Ipopt.Optimizer);

julia> set_optimizer_attribute(model, "print_level", 0);

julia> @infinite_parameter(model, t in [0, 10], num_supports = 10);

julia> @variable(model, y >= 0, Infinite(t));

julia> @variable(model, z >= 0);

julia> @objective(model, Min, 2z);

julia> @constraint(model, c1, z >= y);

julia> @constraint(model, c2, y(0) == 42);

julia> print(model)
Min 2 z
Subject to
 y(t) ≥ 0.0, ∀ t ∈ [0, 10]
 z ≥ 0.0
 c1 : z - y(t) ≥ 0.0, ∀ t ∈ [0, 10]
 y(0) ≥ 0.0
 c2 : y(0) = 42.0

julia> optimize!(model)

```
Now that the model has been optimized, let's find out what happened. To determine 
why the optimizer stopped, we can use 
[`termination_status`](@ref) to report the corresponding `MathOptInterface` 
termination code (possible codes are explained 
[here](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/v0.21.8/reference/solutions/#MathOptInterface.TerminationStatusCode).
```jldoctest results
julia> termination_status(model)
LOCALLY_SOLVED::TerminationStatusCode = 4
```
Here we see that our model was locally solved via Ipopt and that is why it 
stopped. Furthermore, we can query the primal and dual problem optimalities via 
[`primal_status`](@ref JuMP.primal_status(::InfiniteModel)) and 
[`dual_status`](@ref JuMP.dual_status(::InfiniteModel)), respectively.
```jldoctest results
julia> primal_status(model)
FEASIBLE_POINT::ResultStatusCode = 1

julia> dual_status(model)
FEASIBLE_POINT::ResultStatusCode = 1
```
The possible statuses are detailed [here](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/v0.21.8/reference/solutions/#MathOptInterface.ResultStatusCode). 
These results are useful in knowing if information can be drawn from the primal 
and/or dual and what it means. We can also verify that we indeed have answers 
via [`has_values`](@ref) which indicates if our model has optimized variable 
values.
```jldoctest results
julia> has_values(model)
true
```
And indeed we do have values.

Now we can query the objective value via [`objective_value`](@ref) which reports
the optimal objective value.
```jldoctest results
julia> objective_value(model)
83.99999998250514
```
Great now we can inquire about variable values via 
[`value`](@ref JuMP.value(::GeneralVariableRef)). First, let's retrieve the value
of `z`:
```jldoctest results
julia> value(z)
41.99999999125257
```
We get a single value since `z` is a `FiniteVariable` and therefore finite. Now 
let's retrieve the "value" of `y(t)` which is infinite with respect to `t`:
```jldoctest results
julia> value(y)
10-element Vector{Float64}:
 42.0
 20.999999995620495
 20.999999995620495
 20.999999995620495
 20.999999995620495
 20.999999995620495
 20.999999995620495
 20.999999995620495
 20.999999995620495
 20.999999995620495
```
Notice here we obtain an array of values since these correspond to the 
transcribed finite (discretized) variables used to solve the problem. We obtain 
the corresponding support (discretized `t`) values via `supports`:
```jldoctest results
julia> supports(y)
10-element Vector{Tuple}:
 (0.0,)
 (1.11111111111,)
 (2.22222222222,)
 (3.33333333333,)
 (4.44444444444,)
 (5.55555555556,)
 (6.66666666667,)
 (7.77777777778,)
 (8.88888888889,)
 (10.0,)
```
There is 1-to-1 correspondence between these supports and the values reported 
above. Note that these are stored in tuples to facilitate multiple infinite 
parameter dependencies.

!!! note
    The values for an array of variables is obtained via the vectorized call 
    of `value` following the syntax:
    ```julia
    value.(::AbstractArray{<:GeneralVariableRef})
    ```
    This also holds true for many other methods in `InfiniteOpt`. For example, 
    adding the dot also vectorizes `dual` and `set_binary`.

We can also query the dual of a constraint via 
[`dual`](@ref JuMP.dual(::InfOptConstraintRef)) if a model has duals available
as indicated by [`has_duals`](@ref):
```jldoctest results
julia> has_duals(model)
true

julia> dual(c1)
10-element Vector{Float64}:
 1.9999999988666093
 1.1930560126841273e-10
 1.1930560126841273e-10
 1.1930560126841273e-10
 1.1930560126841273e-10
 1.1930560126841273e-10
 1.1930560126841273e-10
 1.1930560126841273e-10
 1.1930560126841273e-10
 1.1930560126841273e-10
```
`c1` is an infinite constraint and thus we obtain the duals of its transcribed 
versions. The underlying infinite parameter(s) and support values are queried 
via `parameter_refs` and `supports`:
```jldoctest results
julia> parameter_refs(c1)
(t,)

julia> supports(c1)
10-element Vector{Tuple}:
 (0.0,)
 (1.11111111111,)
 (2.22222222222,)
 (3.33333333333,)
 (4.44444444444,)
 (5.55555555556,)
 (6.66666666667,)
 (7.77777777778,)
 (8.88888888889,)
 (10.0,)
```
These again all have a 1-to-1 correspondence.

!!! note
    In the case that our variables/constraints depend on multiple infinite 
    parameter it is typically convenient to add the keyword statement 
    `ndarray = true` when calling any variable/constraint queries (e.g., `value` 
    and `dual`). This will reformat the output vector into a n-dimensional array 
    whose dimensions correspond to the supports of the infinite parameters. 

## Termination Queries
Termination queries are those that question about how the infinite model was 
solved and what its optimized state entails. Programmatically, such queries on 
the `InfiniteModel` are simply routed to its optimizer model.

The commonly used queries include [`termination_status`](@ref), 
[`primal_status`](@ref), [`dual_status`](@ref), [`objective_value`](@ref),
[`result_count`](@ref), and [`solve_time`](@ref). The first four are well 
exemplified in the Basic Usage section above and are helpful in quickly 
understanding the optimality status of a given model following the many possible 
statuses reported by `MathOptInterface` which are documented 
[here](https://jump.dev/MathOptInterface.jl/v0.9.22/manual/solutions/#Solutions). 
We use `result_count` to determine how many solutions are recorded in the 
optimizer.
```jldoctest results
julia> result_count(model)
1
```
This is useful since it informs what results there are which can be specified 
via the `result` keyword argument in many methods such as `primal_status`, 
`dual_status`, `objective_value`, `value`, `dual`, and more.

We use `solve_time` to determine the time in seconds used by the optimizer until 
it terminated its search.
```julia-repl
julia> solve_time(model)
0.004999876022338867
```
Note that this query might not be supported with all solvers.

The above status queries are designed to report information in a consistent 
format irrespective of the chosen optimizer. However, [`raw_status`](@ref) will 
provide the optimality status verbatim as reported by the optimizer. Thus, 
following our example with Ipopt we obtain:
```jldoctest results
julia> raw_status(model)
"Solve_Succeeded"
```

Also, we obtain the best objective bound via [`objective_bound`](@ref) which 
becomes particularly useful solutions that are suboptimal. However, this method 
is not supported by all optimizers and in this case Ipopt is one such optimizer.

Finally, we get the best dual objective value via [`dual_objective_value`](@ref) 
if the optimizer supplies this information which again Ipopt does not.

## Variable Queries
Information about the optimized variables is gathered consistently in comparison 
to typical `JuMP` models. With `InfiniteModel`s this is done by querying the 
optimizer model and using its stored variable mappings to return the correct 
information. Thus, here the queries are extended to work with the specifics of 
the optimizer model to return the appropriate info.

!!! note 
    1. Like `supports` the all variable based query methods below also employ the 
       `label::Type{AbstractSupportLabel} = PublicLabel` keyword argument that by 
       default will return the desired information associated with public 
       supports. The full set (e.g., ones corresponding to internal collocation nodes) 
       is obtained via `label = All`.
    2. These methods also employ the `ndarray::Bool` keyword argument that will cause the 
       output to be formatted as a n-dimensional array where the dimensions 
       correspond to the infinite parameter dependencies. For example, if we have an 
       infinite variable `y(t, ξ)` and we invoke a query method with `ndarray = true` 
       then we'll get a matrix whose dimensions correspond to the supports of `t` and 
       `ξ`, respectively. Also, if `ndarray = true` then `label` correspond to the 
       intersection of supports labels in contrast to its default of invoking the union 
       of the labels.

First, we should verify that the optimized model in fact has variable values 
via [`has_values`](@ref). In our example, we have:
```jldoctest results
julia> has_values(model)
true
```
So we have values readily available to be extracted.

Now [`value`](@ref JuMP.value(::GeneralVariableRef)) can be used to query the 
values as shown above in the Basic Usage section. This works by calling the 
appropriate [`map_value`](@ref InfiniteOpt.map_value) defined by the optimizer 
model. By default this, employs the `map_value` fallback which uses 
`optimizer_model_variable` to do the mapping. Details on how to extend these 
methods for user-defined optimizer models is explained on the Extensions page.

We also, support call to `value` that use an expression of variables as input.

Finally, the optimizer index of a variable is queried via 
[`optimizer_index`](@ref JuMP.optimizer_index(::GeneralVariableRef)) which 
reports back the index of the variable as used in the `MathOptInterface` 
backend:
```jldoctest results
julia> optimizer_index(z)
MathOptInterface.VariableIndex(1)

julia> optimizer_index(y)
10-element Vector{MathOptInterface.VariableIndex}:
 MathOptInterface.VariableIndex(2)
 MathOptInterface.VariableIndex(3)
 MathOptInterface.VariableIndex(4)
 MathOptInterface.VariableIndex(5)
 MathOptInterface.VariableIndex(6)
 MathOptInterface.VariableIndex(7)
 MathOptInterface.VariableIndex(8)
 MathOptInterface.VariableIndex(9)
 MathOptInterface.VariableIndex(10)
 MathOptInterface.VariableIndex(11)
```
As noted previously, an array is returned for `y(t)` in accordance with its 
transcription variables. In similar manner to `value`, this is enabled by 
appropriate versions of [`map_optimizer_index`](@ref InfiniteOpt.map_optimizer_index).

## Constraint Queries
Like variables, a variety of information can be queried about constraints.

!!! note 
    1. Like `supports` the all constraint query methods below also employ the 
       `label::Type{AbstractSupportLabel} = PublicLabel` keyword argument that by 
       default will return the desired information associated with public 
       supports. The full set (e.g., ones corresponding to internal collocation nodes) 
       is obtained via `label = All`.
    2. These methods also employ the `ndarray::Bool` keyword argument that will cause the 
       output to be formatted as a n-dimensional array where the dimensions 
       correspond to the infinite parameter dependencies. For example, if we have an 
       infinite constraint that depends on `t` and `ξ)` and we invoke a query method 
       with `ndarray = true` then we'll get a matrix whose dimensions correspond to 
       the supports of `t` and `ξ`, respectively. Also, if `ndarray = true` then 
       `label` correspond to the intersection of supports labels in contrast to its 
       default of invoking the union of the labels.

First, recall that constraints are stored in the form `function-in-set` where 
generally `function` contains the variables and coefficients and the set contains 
the relational operator and the constant value. With this understanding, we 
query the value of a constraint's `function` via 
[`value`](@ref JuMP.value(::InfOptConstraintRef)):
```jldoctest results
julia> constraint_object(c1).func # show the function expression of c1
z - y(t)

julia> value(c1)
10-element Vector{Float64}:
 -8.747427671096375e-9
 20.999999995632077
 20.999999995632077
 20.999999995632077
 20.999999995632077
 20.999999995632077
 20.999999995632077
 20.999999995632077
 20.999999995632077
 20.999999995632077
```
Again, we obtain an array of values since `c1` is infinite due to its dependence 
on `x(t)`. Behind the scenes this is implemented via the appropriate extensions 
of [`map_value`](@ref InfiniteOpt.map_value).

Next the optimizer index(es) of the transcribed constraints in the 
`MathOptInterface` backend provided via 
[`optimizer_index`](@ref JuMP.optimizer_index(::InfOptConstraintRef)).
```jldoctest results
julia> optimizer_index(c1)
10-element Vector{MathOptInterface.ConstraintIndex{MathOptInterface.ScalarAffineFunction{Float64}, MathOptInterface.GreaterThan{Float64}}}:
 MathOptInterface.ConstraintIndex{MathOptInterface.ScalarAffineFunction{Float64},MathOptInterface.GreaterThan{Float64}}(1)
 MathOptInterface.ConstraintIndex{MathOptInterface.ScalarAffineFunction{Float64},MathOptInterface.GreaterThan{Float64}}(2)
 MathOptInterface.ConstraintIndex{MathOptInterface.ScalarAffineFunction{Float64},MathOptInterface.GreaterThan{Float64}}(3)
 MathOptInterface.ConstraintIndex{MathOptInterface.ScalarAffineFunction{Float64},MathOptInterface.GreaterThan{Float64}}(4)
 MathOptInterface.ConstraintIndex{MathOptInterface.ScalarAffineFunction{Float64},MathOptInterface.GreaterThan{Float64}}(5)
 MathOptInterface.ConstraintIndex{MathOptInterface.ScalarAffineFunction{Float64},MathOptInterface.GreaterThan{Float64}}(6)
 MathOptInterface.ConstraintIndex{MathOptInterface.ScalarAffineFunction{Float64},MathOptInterface.GreaterThan{Float64}}(7)
 MathOptInterface.ConstraintIndex{MathOptInterface.ScalarAffineFunction{Float64},MathOptInterface.GreaterThan{Float64}}(8)
 MathOptInterface.ConstraintIndex{MathOptInterface.ScalarAffineFunction{Float64},MathOptInterface.GreaterThan{Float64}}(9)
 MathOptInterface.ConstraintIndex{MathOptInterface.ScalarAffineFunction{Float64},MathOptInterface.GreaterThan{Float64}}(10)
```
Here 10 indices are given in accordance with the transcription constraints. 
The mapping between these and the original infinite constraints is managed via 
the appropriate extensions of [`map_optimizer_index`](@ref InfiniteOpt.map_optimizer_index).

We can also query dual information from our constraints if it is available. 
First, we should verify that dual information is available via 
[`has_duals`](@ref):
```jldoctest results
julia> has_duals(model)
true
```
Now we can query the duals via [`dual`](@ref JuMP.dual(::InfOptConstraintRef)).
```jldoctest results
julia> dual(c1)
10-element Vector{Float64}:
 1.9999999988666093
 1.1930560126841273e-10
 1.1930560126841273e-10
 1.1930560126841273e-10
 1.1930560126841273e-10
 1.1930560126841273e-10
 1.1930560126841273e-10
 1.1930560126841273e-10
 1.1930560126841273e-10
 1.1930560126841273e-10
```
Here we obtain the optimal dual values for each transcribed version of `c1`. This 
is enabled via the proper extensions of [`map_dual`](@ref InfiniteOpt.map_dual).

Finally, we query the shadow price of a constraint via 
[`shadow_price`](@ref JuMP.shadow_price(::InfOptConstraintRef)). This denotes 
the change in the objective value due to an infinitesimal relaxation of the 
constraint. For `c1` we get:
```jldoctest results
julia> shadow_price(c1)
10-element Vector{Float64}:
 -1.9999999988666093
 -1.1930560126841273e-10
 -1.1930560126841273e-10
 -1.1930560126841273e-10
 -1.1930560126841273e-10
 -1.1930560126841273e-10
 -1.1930560126841273e-10
 -1.1930560126841273e-10
 -1.1930560126841273e-10
 -1.1930560126841273e-10
```
Similarly, the mapping to the transcription constraints is enabled via the 
appropriate version of [`map_shadow_price`](@ref InfiniteOpt.map_shadow_price).

## LP Sensitivity
We also conduct sensitivity analysis for linear problems using 
[`lp_sensitivity_report`](@ref JuMP.lp_sensitivity_report(::InfiniteModel)). This 
will generate a [`InfOptSensitivityReport`](@ref) which contains mapping to the 
ranges indicating how much a constraint RHS constant or a objective 
coefficient can be changed without violating the feasibility of the solution. 
This is further explained in the JuMP documentation 
[here](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/v0.21.8/manual/solutions/#Sensitivity-analysis-for-LP). 
Furthermore, these analysis can only be employed for a solver that implements 
`MOI.ConstraintBasisStatus`. In our running example up above, `Ipopt.jl` does not 
support this A solver like `Gurobi.jl` does.
```julia-repl
julia> report = lp_sensitivity_report(model);

julia> report[c1]
10-element Vector{Tuple{Float64, Float64}}:
 (-42.0, Inf)
 (-Inf, 42.0)
 (-Inf, 42.0)
 (-Inf, 42.0)
 (-Inf, 42.0)
 (-Inf, 42.0)
 (-Inf, 42.0)
 (-Inf, 42.0)
 (-Inf, 42.0)
 (-Inf, 42.0)

julia> report[z]
(-2.0, Inf)
```
Note that like other query methods, an array of ranges will be provided with
testing the sensitivity of an infinite constraint RHS in accordance with the
discretization scheme. Also, keyword arguments (like `ndarray` and `label`) can 
be invoked when indexing the report:
```julia-repl
julia> report[c1, label = All]
10-element Vector{Tuple{Float64, Float64}}:
 (-42.0, Inf)
 (-Inf, 42.0)
 (-Inf, 42.0)
 (-Inf, 42.0)
 (-Inf, 42.0)
 (-Inf, 42.0)
 (-Inf, 42.0)
 (-Inf, 42.0)
 (-Inf, 42.0)
 (-Inf, 42.0)
```

## Other Queries
Any other queries supported by `JuMP` can be accessed by simply interrogating the 
optimizer model directly using [`optimizer_model`](@ref) to access it. For 
example, we can get the solution summary of the optimizer model:
```julia-repl
julia> solution_summary(optimizer_model(model))
* Solver : Ipopt

* Status
  Termination status : LOCALLY_SOLVED
  Primal status      : FEASIBLE_POINT
  Dual status        : FEASIBLE_POINT
  Message from the solver:
  "Solve_Succeeded"

* Candidate solution
  Objective value      : 83.99999998250514

* Work counters
  Solve time (sec)   : 0.01000
```
