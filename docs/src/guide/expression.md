# [Expressions](@id expr_docs)
A guide for the defining and understanding the variable expressions 
used in `InfiniteOpt`. See the [technical manual](@ref expr_manual) for more 
details.

!!! note 
    Nonlinear modeling is handled differently in `InfiniteOpt` vs `JuMP`. See 
    [Nonlinear Expressions](@ref nlp_guide) for more information. 

## Overview
Expressions in `InfiniteOpt` (also called functions) refer to mathematical 
statements involving variables and numbers. Thus, these comprise the 
mathematical expressions used that are used in measures, objectives, and 
constraints. Programmatically, `InfiniteOpt` simply extends `JuMP` expression 
types and methods principally pertaining to affine and quadratic mathematical 
expressions. A natively supported abstraction for general nonlinear expressions 
is planned for development since that of `JuMP` is not readily extendable.

## [Parameter Functions](@id par_func_docs)
As described further below, InfiniteOpt.jl only supports affine and quadratic 
expressions in its current rendition. However, there several use cases where we 
might want to provide a more complex known function of infinite parameter(s) (e.g., 
nonlinear setpoint tracking). Thus, we provide parameter function objects 
that given a particular realization of infinite parameters will output a scalar 
value. Note that this can be interpreted as an infinite variable that is 
constrained to a particular known function. This is accomplished via 
[`@parameter_function`](@ref) or [`parameter_function`](@ref) and is exemplified 
by defining a parameter function `f(t)` that uses `sin(t)`:
```jldoctest param_func
julia> using InfiniteOpt;

julia> model = InfiniteModel();

julia> @infinite_parameter(model, t in [0, 10]);

julia> @parameter_function(model, f == sin(t))
f(t)
```
Here we created a parameter function object, added it to `model`, and 
then created a Julia variable `f` that serves as a `GeneralVariableRef` that points 
to it. From here we can treat `f` as a normal infinite variable and use it with 
measures, derivatives, and constraints. For example, we can do the following:
```jldoctest param_func
julia> @variable(model, y, Infinite(t));

julia> df = deriv(f, t)
∂/∂t[f(t)]

julia> meas = integral(y - f, t)
∫{t ∈ [0, 10]}[y(t) - f(t)]

julia> @constraint(model, y - f <= 0)
y(t) - f(t) ≤ 0, ∀ t ∈ [0, 10]
```
We can also define parameter functions that depend on multiple infinite 
parameters even use an anonymous function if preferred:
```jldoctest param_func
julia> @infinite_parameter(model, x[1:2] in [-1, 1]);

julia> @parameter_function(model, myname == (t, x) -> t + sum(x))
myname(t, x)
```
In many applications, we may also desire to define an array of parameter functions 
that each use a different realization of some parent function by varying some 
additional positional/keyword arguments. We readily support this behavior since 
parameter functions can be defined with additional known arguments:
```jldoctest param_func
julia> @parameter_function(model, pfunc_alt[i = 1:3] == t -> mysin(t, as[i], b = 0))
3-element Vector{GeneralVariableRef}:
 pfunc_alt[1](t)
 pfunc_alt[2](t)
 pfunc_alt[3](t)
```
The main recommended use case for [`parameter_function`](@ref) is that it is 
amenable to define complex anonymous functions via a do-block which is useful 
for applications like defining a time-varied setpoint:
```jldoctest param_func
julia> setpoint = parameter_function(t, name = "setpoint") do t_supp
                    if t_supp <= 5
                        return 2.0
                    else 
                        return 10.2
                    end
                 end
setpoint(t)
```
Please consult the following links for more information about defining parameter 
functions: [`@parameter_function`](@ref) and [`parameter_function`](@ref).

Beyond this, there are a number of query and modification methods that can be 
employed for parameter functions and these are detailed in the 
[technical manual](@ref par_func_manual) Section below.

## Variable Hierarchy
Expressions employ variable reference types inherited from
`JuMP.AbstractVariableRef` to form expression objects. `InfiniteOpt`
uses a hierarchy of such types to organize the complexities associated with
modeling infinite dimensional programs. The figure below summarizes this
hierarchy of variable reference types where the abstract types are depicted in
green and the concrete types are shown blue.

![tree](../assets/variable_tree.png)

In consistently with `JuMP` expression support, [`GeneralVariableRef`](@ref)
exists as a variable reference type that is able to represent any of the above
concrete subtypes of [`DispatchVariableRef`](@ref). This allows the expression
containers to be homogeneous in variable type. This is a paradigm shift from
previous versions of `InfiniteOpt` that used the hierarchy of types directly
to construct expressions. This behavior led to stability and performance
limitations and thus a has been discontinued.

However, the variable hierarchy is still used to create for variable methods.
To accomplish this appropriate `GeneralVariableRef` dispatch methods are implemented
(which are detailed in User Methods section at the bottom of this page) that
utilize [`dispatch_variable_ref`](@ref) to create the appropriate concrete
subtype of `DispatchVariableRef` and call the appropriate underlying method.
These dispatch methods have been implemented for all public methods and the
underlying methods are what are documented in the method manuals throughout the
User Guide pages.

## Affine Expressions
An affine expression pertains to a mathematical function of the form:
```math
f_a(x) = a_1x_1 + ... + a_nx_n + b
```
where ``x \in \mathbb{R}^n`` denote variables, ``a \in \mathbb{R}^n`` denote 
coefficients, and ``b \in \mathbb{R}`` denotes a constant value. Such 
expressions, are prevalent in any problem than involves linear constraints 
and/or objectives.

In `InfiniteOpt`, affine expressions can be defined directly 
using `Julia`'s arithmetic operators (i.e., `+`, `-`, `*`, etc.) or using 
`@expression`.  For example, let's define the expression 
``2y(t) + z - 3t`` noting that the following methods are equivalent:
```jldoctest affine; setup = :(using InfiniteOpt; model = InfiniteModel())
julia> @infinite_parameter(model, t in [0, 10])
t

julia> @variable(model, y, Infinite(t))
y(t)

julia> @variable(model, z)
z

julia> expr = 2y + z - 3t
2 y(t) + z - 3 t

julia> expr = 2 * y + z - 3 * t
2 y(t) + z - 3 t

julia> expr = @expression(model, 2y + z - 3t)
2 y(t) + z - 3 t

julia> typeof(expr)
GenericAffExpr{Float64, GeneralVariableRef}
```
Notice that coefficients to variables can simply be put alongside variables 
without having to use the `*` operator. Also, note that all of these expressions 
are stored in a container referred to as a `GenericAffExpr` which is a `JuMP` 
object for storing affine expressions.

!!! note
    Where possible, it is preferable to use 
    [`@expression`](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/v1/api/JuMP/#JuMP.@expression) 
    for defining expressions as it is much more efficient than explicitly using 
    the standard operators.

`GenericAffExpr` objects contain 2 fields which are:
- `constant::CoefType` The constant value of the affine expression.
- `terms::OrderDict{VarType, CoefType}` A dictionary mapping variables to coefficients.
For example, let's see what these fields look like in the above example:
```jldoctest affine
julia> expr.terms
OrderedCollections.OrderedDict{GeneralVariableRef, Float64} with 3 entries:
  y(t) => 2.0
  z    => 1.0
  t    => -3.0

julia> expr.constant
0.0
```
Notice that the ordered dictionary preserves the order in which the variables 
appear in the expression.

More information can be found in the documentation for affine expressions in 
[`JuMP`](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/v1/api/JuMP/#JuMP.GenericAffExpr).

## Quadratic Expressions
A quadratic function pertains to a mathematical function of the form:
```math
f_q(x) = a_1x_1^2 + a_2 x_1 x_2 + ... + a_m x_n^2 + f_a(x)
```
where ``x \in \mathbb{R}^n`` are the variables,
``f_a(x): \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \mathbb{R}`` is an affine function, and
``m = n(n+1)/2`` is the number of unique combinations of variables ``x``.
Like affine expressions, quadratic expressions can be defined via `Julia`'s
arithmetic operators or via `@expression`. For example, let's define
``2y^2(t) - zy(t) + 42t - 3`` using the following equivalent methods:
```jldoctest affine
julia> expr = 2y^2 - z * y + 42t - 3
2 y(t)² - z*y(t) + 42 t - 3

julia> expr = @expression(model, 2y^2 - z * y + 42t - 3)
2 y(t)² - y(t)*z + 42 t - 3

julia> typeof(expr)
GenericQuadExpr{Float64, GeneralVariableRef}
```
Again, notice that coefficients need not employ `*`. Also, the object used to 
store the expression is a `GenericQuadExpr` which is a `JuMP` object used for 
storing quadratic expressions.

`GenericQuadExpr` object contains 2 data fields which are:
- `aff::GenericAffExpr{CoefType,VarType}` An affine expression
- `terms::OrderedDict{UnorderedPair{VarType}, CoefType}` A dictionary mapping quadratic variable pairs to coefficients.
Here the `UnorderedPair` type is unique to `JuMP` and contains the fields:
- `a::AbstractVariableRef` One variable in a quadratic pair
- `b::AbstractVariableRef` The other variable in a quadratic pair.
Thus, this form can be used to store arbitrary quadratic expressions. For 
example, let's look at what these fields look like in the above example:
```jldoctest affine
julia> expr.aff
42 t - 3

julia> typeof(expr.aff)
GenericAffExpr{Float64, GeneralVariableRef}

julia> expr.terms
OrderedCollections.OrderedDict{UnorderedPair{GeneralVariableRef}, Float64} with 2 entries:
  UnorderedPair{GeneralVariableRef}(y(t), y(t)) => 2.0
  UnorderedPair{GeneralVariableRef}(y(t), z)    => -1.0
```
Notice again that the ordered dictionary preserves the order.

!!! tip
    Polynomial expressions can be represented by introducing dummy variables 
    and nested quadratic/affine expressions. For instance, ``z^3 + 2`` can be 
    expressed by introducing a dummy variable ``x = z^2``:
    ```jldoctest affine
    julia> @variable(model, x)
    x

    julia> @constraint(model, x == z^2)
    -z² + x = 0

    julia> expr = @expression(model, z * x + 2)
    z*x + 2
    ```
    Alternatively, can we can just use our nonlinear modeling interface:
    ```jldoctest affine
    julia> expr = @expression(model, z^3 + 2)
    z^3 + 2
    ```

More information can be found in the documentation for quadratic expressions in 
[`JuMP`](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/v1/api/JuMP/#JuMP.GenericQuadExpr).

## [Nonlinear Expressions](@id nlp_guide)
General nonlinear expressions as generated via `JuMP.@NLexpression`, 
`JuMP.@NLobjective`, and/or `JuMP.@NLconstraint` macros in `JuMP` are not 
extendable for extension packages like `InfiniteOpt`. A fundamental 
overhaul is planned to resolve this problem (check the status on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/jump-dev/MathOptInterface.jl/issues/846)), but this 
will likely require 1-3 years to resolve.

!!! info
    `JuMP-dev` has secured funding to overhaul their nonlinear interface and 
    hence the timeline for resolving many of the limitations should be expedited. 
    Check out their [announcement](https://jump.dev/announcements/2022/02/21/lanl/) 
    for more information.

Thus, in the interim, we circumvent this problem in `InfiniteOpt` by implementing 
our own general nonlinear expression API. However, we will see that our interface 
treats nonlinear expressions as 1st class citizens and thus is generally more 
convenient than using `JuMP`'s current legacy nonlinear modeling interface. 
We discuss the ins and outs of this interface in the subsections below.

!!! note
    Unlike affine/quadratic expressions, our nonlinear interface differs from 
    that of `JuMP`. Thus, it is important to carefully review the sections 
    below to familiarize yourself with our syntax. 

!!! warning
    Our new general nonlinear modeling interface is experimental and thus is 
    subject to change to address any unintended behavior. Please notify us on 
    GitHub if you encounter any unexpected behavior.

### Basic Usage 
In `InfiniteOpt` we can define nonlinear expressions in similar manner to how 
affine/quadratic expressions are made in `JuMP`. For instance, we can make an 
expression using normal Julia code outside a macro:
```jldoctest nlp; setup = :(using InfiniteOpt; model = InfiniteModel())
julia> @infinite_parameter(model, t ∈ [0, 1]); @variable(model, y, Infinite(t));

julia> expr = exp(y^2.3) * y - 42
exp(y(t)^2.3) * y(t) - 42

julia> typeof(expr)
NLPExpr
```
Thus, the nonlinear expression `expr` of type [`NLPExpr`](@ref) is created can 
be readily incorporated to other expressions, the objective, and/or constraints. 
For macro-based definition, we simply use the `@expression`, `@objective`, and 
`@constraint` macros (which in `JuMP` are only able to handle affine/quadratic 
expressions):
```jldoctest nlp
julia> @expression(model, expr, exp(y^2.3) * y - 42)
exp(y(t)^2.3) * y(t) - 42

julia> @objective(model, Min, ∫(0.3^cos(y^2), t))
∫{t ∈ [0, 1]}[0.3^cos(y(t)²)]

julia> @constraint(model, constr, y^y * sin(y) + sum(y^i for i in 3:4) == 3)
constr : (y(t)^y(t) * sin(y(t)) + y(t)^3 + y(t)^4) - 3 = 0, ∀ t ∈ [0, 1]
```

!!! note
    The `@NLexpression`, `@NLobjective`, and `@NLconstraint` macros used by `JuMP`
    are not supported by `InfiniteOpt`. Instead, we can more conveniently use the 
    `@expression`, `@objective`, and `@constraint` macros directly.

Natively, we support all the same nonlinear functions/operators that `JuMP` 
does. Note however that there are 3 caveats to this:
- Functions from [`SpecialFunctions.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaMath/SpecialFunctions.jl) 
  can only be used if `using SpecialFunctions` is included first
- The `ifelse` function must be specified [`InfiniteOpt.ifelse`](@ref) (because 
  the native `ifelse` is a core function that cannot be extended for our purposes)
- The logic operators `&` and `|` must be used instead of `&&` and `||` when 
  defining a nonlinear expression.

Let's exemplify the above caveats:
```jldoctest nlp
julia> using SpecialFunctions

julia> y^2.3 * gamma(y)
y(t)^2.3 * gamma(y(t))

julia> InfiniteOpt.ifelse(y == 0, y^2.3, exp(y))
ifelse(y(t) == 0, y(t)^2.3, exp(y(t)))

julia> InfiniteOpt.ifelse((y <= 0) | (y >= 3), y^2.3, exp(y))
ifelse(y(t) <= 0 || y(t) >= 3, y(t)^2.3, exp(y(t)))
```

!!! warning
    The logical comparison operator `==` will yield an `NLPExpr` instead of a 
    `Bool` when one side is a variable reference or an expression. Thus, for 
    creating Julia code that needs to determine if the Julia variables are equal 
    then `isequal` should be used instead:
    ```julia-repl
    julia> isequal(y, y)
    true

    julia> y == t
    y(t) == t
    ```

We can interrogate which nonlinear functions/operators our model currently 
supports by invoking [`all_registered_functions`](@ref). Moreover, we can add 
additional functions via registration (see [Function Registration](@ref) for 
more details). 

Finally, we highlight that nonlinear expressions in `InfiniteOpt` support the 
same linear algebra operations as affine/quadratic expressions:
```jldoctest nlp
julia> @variable(model, v[1:2]); @variable(model, Q[1:2, 1:2]);

julia> @expression(model, v' * Q * v)
0 + (Q[1,1]*v[1] + Q[2,1]*v[2]) * v[1] + (Q[1,2]*v[1] + Q[2,2]*v[2]) * v[2]
```

### Function Tracing
In similar manner to `Symbolics.jl`, we support function tracing. This means 
that we can create nonlinear modeling expression using Julia functions that 
satisfy certain criteria. For instance:
```jldoctest nlp
julia> myfunc(x) = sin(x^3) / tan(2^x);

julia> expr = myfunc(y)
sin(y(t)^3) / tan(2^y(t))
```
However, there are certain limitations as to what internal code these functions 
can contain. The following CANNOT be used:
- loops (unless it only uses very simple operations)
- if-statements (see workaround below)
- non-registered functions (if they cannot be traced).

!!! tip
    If a particular function is not amendable for tracing, try registering it 
    instead. See [Function Registration](@ref) for details.

We can readily workaround the if-statement limitation using 
[`InfiniteOpt.ifelse`](@ref). For example, the function:
```julia
function mylogicfunc(x)
    if x >= 0
        return x^3
    else
        return 0
    end
end
```
is not amendable for function tracing, but we can rewrite it as:
```jldoctest nlp
julia> function mylogicfunc(x)
          return InfiniteOpt.ifelse(x >= 0, x^3, 0)
       end
mylogicfunc (generic function with 1 method)

julia> mylogicfunc(y)
ifelse(y(t) >= 0, y(t)^3, 0)
```
which is amendable for function tracing.

### Linear Algebra
As described above in the Basic Usage Section, we support linear algebra 
operations with nonlinear expressions! This relies on our basic extensions of 
[`MutableArithmetics`](https://github.com/jump-dev/MutableArithmetics.jl), but 
admittedly this implementation is not perfect in terms of efficiency. 

!!! tip 
    Using linear algebra operations with nonlinear expression provides user 
    convenience, but is less efficient than using `sum`s. Thus, `sum` should be 
    used instead when efficiency is critical.
    ```jldoctest nlp
    julia> v' * Q * v # convenient linear algebra syntax
    0 + (Q[1,1]*v[1] + Q[2,1]*v[2]) * v[1] + (Q[1,2]*v[1] + Q[2,2]*v[2]) * v[2]

    julia> sum(v[i] * Q[i, j] * v[j] for i in 1:2, j in 1:2) # more efficient
    v[1] * Q[1,1] * v[1] + v[2] * Q[2,1] * v[1] + v[1] * Q[1,2] * v[2] + v[2] * Q[2,2] * v[2]
    ```

We can also set vectorized constraints using the `.==`, `.<=`, and `.>=` 
operators:
```jldoctest nlp
julia> @variable(model, W[1:2, 1:2]);

julia> @constraint(model, W * Q * v .== 0)
2-element Vector{InfOptConstraintRef}:
 (0 + (W[1,1]*Q[1,1] + W[1,2]*Q[2,1]) * v[1] + (W[1,1]*Q[1,2] + W[1,2]*Q[2,2]) * v[2]) - 0 = 0
 (0 + (W[2,1]*Q[1,1] + W[2,2]*Q[2,1]) * v[1] + (W[2,1]*Q[1,2] + W[2,2]*Q[2,2]) * v[2]) - 0 = 0
```

However, it is important to note that although vector constraints can be 
expressed in `InfiniteOpt`, they are not supported by `JuMP` and thus an error 
is incurred if we try to solve an `InfiniteOpt` model using the 
`TranscriptionOpt` backend:
```jldoctest nlp
julia> @constraint(model, W * Q * v in MOI.Zeros(2)) # will cause solution error 
[0 + (W[1,1]*Q[1,1] + W[1,2]*Q[2,1]) * v[1] + (W[1,1]*Q[1,2] + W[1,2]*Q[2,2]) * v[2], 0 + (W[2,1]*Q[1,1] + W[2,2]*Q[2,1]) * v[1] + (W[2,1]*Q[1,2] + W[2,2]*Q[2,2]) * v[2]] in MathOptInterface.Zeros(2)

julia> optimize!(model)
ERROR: TranscriptionOpt does not support vector constraints of general nonlinear expressions because this is not yet supported by JuMP.
```

### Function Registration
In a similar spirit to `JuMP` and `Symbolics`, we can register user-defined 
functions such that they can be directly incorporated into nonlinear expressions. 
This is done via the [`@register`](@ref) macro. We can register any function 
that takes scalar arguments (which can accept inputs of type `Real`):
```jldoctest nlp
julia> h(a, b) = a * b^2; # an overly simple example user-defined function

julia> @register(model, h(a, b));

julia> h(y, 42)
h(y(t), 42)
```

!!! tip
    Where possible it is preferred to use function tracing instead of function 
    registration. This improves performance and can prevent unintentional errors. 
    See [Function Tracing](@ref) for more details.

To highlight the difference between function tracing and function 
registration consider the following example:
```jldoctest nlp
julia> f(a) = a^3;

julia> f(y) # user-function gets traced
y(t)^3

julia> @register(model, f(a)) # register function
f (generic function with 2 methods)

julia> f(y) # function is no longer traced
f(y(t))
```
Thus, registered functions are incorporated directly. This means that their 
gradients and hessians will need to determined as well (typically occurs 
behind the scenes via auto-differentiation with the selected optimizer model 
backend). However, again please note that in this case tracing is preferred 
since `f` can be traced. 

Let's consider a more realistic example where the function is not amenable to 
tracing:
```jldoctest nlp
julia> function g(a)
          v = 0
          for i in 1:4
              v *= v^a
              if v >= 1
                 return v
              end
          end
          return a
       end;

julia> @register(model, g(a));

julia> g(y)
g(y(t))
```
Notice this example is a little contrived still, highlighting that in most cases 
we can avoid registration. However, one exception to this trend, are functions 
from other packages that we might want to use. For example, perhaps we would 
like to use the `eta` function from `SpecialFunctions.jl` which is not natively 
supported:
```jldoctest nlp
julia> using SpecialFunctions

julia> my_eta(a) = eta(a);

julia> @register(model, my_eta(a));

julia> my_eta(y)
my_eta(y(t))
```
Notice that we cannot register `SpecialFunctions.eta` directly due to 
scoping limitations that are inherited in generating constructor functions on the 
fly (which necessarily occurs behind the scenes with [`@register`](@ref)).

Now in some cases we might wish to specify the gradient and hessian of a 
univariate function we register to avoid the need for auto-differentiation. We 
can do this, simply by adding them as additional arguments when we register:
```jldoctest nlp
julia> my_squared(a) = a^2; gradient(a) = 2 * a; hessian(a) = 2;

julia> @register(model, my_squared(a), gradient, hessian);

julia> my_squared(y)
my_squared(y(t))
```
Note the specification of the hessian is optional (it can separately be 
computed via auto-differentiation if need be).

For multivariate functions, we can specify the gradient (the hessian is not 
currently supported by `JuMP` optimizer models) following the same gradient 
function structure that `JuMP` uses:
```jldoctest nlp
julia> w(a, b) = a * b^2;

julia> function wg(v, a, b)
          v[1] = b^2
          v[2] = 2 * a * b
          return
       end;

julia> @register(model, w(a, b), wg) # register multi-argument function
w (generic function with 4 methods)

julia> w(42, y)
w(42, y(t))
```
Note that the first argument of the gradient needs to accept an 
`AbstractVector{Real}` that is then filled in place.

!!! note
    We do not currently support vector inputs or vector valued functions 
    directly, since typically `JuMP` optimizer model backends don't support them. 
    However, this limitation can readily be removed if there is a use case for it 
    (please reach out to us if such an addition is needed).

### Expression Tree Abstraction
The nonlinear interface in `InfiniteOpt` is enabled through the [`NLPExpr`](@ref) 
type which uses an intelligent expression tree structure. In particular, we use 
a memory efficient [Left-Child Right-Sibling Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-child_right-sibling_binary_tree) 
whose leaves (nodes with no children) can be:
- constants (i.e., `Int`, `Float64`, and/or `Bool`)
- variables ([`GeneralVariableRef`](@ref)s)
- affine expressions (`GenericAffExpr{Float64, GeneralVariableRef}`)
- quadratic expressions (`GenericQuadExpr{Float64, GeneralVariableRef}`)
Moreover, the internal tree nodes correspond to functions/operators which are 
stored as `Symbol` names (which correspond to registered functions via 
[`name_to_function`](@ref)). We accomplish this via 
[`LeftChildRightSiblingTrees.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaCollections/LeftChildRightSiblingTrees.jl) 
in combination with [`NodeData`](@ref) to store the content of each node. 

We can view the tree structure of an [`NLPExpr`](@ref) using 
[`print_expression_tree`](@ref):
```jldoctest nlp
julia> expr = exp(y^2.3) * y - 42
exp(y(t)^2.3) * y(t) - 42

julia> print_expression_tree(expr)
-
├─ *
│  ├─ exp
│  │  └─ ^
│  │     ├─ y(t)
│  │     └─ 2.3
│  └─ y(t)
└─ 42
```
Here, we can see the algebraic expression is decomposed into an expression 
tree were the leaves contain the variables/constants (and can contain 
affine/quadratic expressions) and the intermediate nodes contain function 
names. Note that the top most node is called the root node and that is what 
[`NLPExpr`](@ref) stores in its `tree_root` field:
```jldoctest nlp
julia> expr.tree_root
Node(-)

julia> typeof(expr.tree_root)
LeftChildRightSiblingTrees.Node{NodeData}
```
The rest of the tree can then be interrogated by traversing the tree as enabled 
by the API of 
[`LeftChildRightSiblingTrees.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaCollections/LeftChildRightSiblingTrees.jl).

In addition to the API of `LeftChildRightSiblingTrees.jl`, we provide some 
mapping functions that are useful for extensions. First, with 
[`map_expression`](@ref) we can create a new `NLPExpr` based on an existing 
`NLPExpr` where a transformation is applied to each variable:
```jldoctest nlp
julia> map_expression(v -> v^2, expr)
exp((y(t)²)^2.3) * (y(t)²) - 42
```
We also provide [`map_nlp_to_ast`](@ref) which can be used to map an `NLPExpr` to a 
Julia Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) where a transformation is applied to each 
variable:
```jldoctest nlp
julia> jump_model = Model(); @variable(jump_model, y_jump);

julia> map_nlp_to_ast(v -> y_jump, expr)
:(exp(y_jump ^ 2.3) * y_jump - 42)
```
This is useful for converting `NLPExpr`s into ASTs that can be used in `JuMP` 
via its [`add_nonlinear_expression`](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/v1/manual/nlp/#Raw-expression-input) 
API.
