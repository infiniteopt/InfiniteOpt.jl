A `JuMP` extension for expressing and solving infinite-dimensional optimization 
problems.

!!! warning
    `InfiniteOpt v0.4.0` underwent a number of breaking syntax changes 
    relative to previous versions. This is to promote long term code stability 
    and to increase the capabilities of `InfiniteOpt`. Please review the guide 
    to see updated syntax. Deprecation warnings have been incorporated into this 
    version to help convert old scripts.

## What is InfiniteOpt?
`InfiniteOpt.jl` provides a general mathematical abstraction to express and solve 
infinite-dimensional optimization problems (i.e., problems with decision 
functions). Such problems stem from areas such as space-time programming and 
stochastic programming. `InfiniteOpt` is meant to facilitate intuitive model 
definition, automatic transcription into solvable models, permit a wide range 
of user-defined extensions/behavior, and more. 

It builds upon `JuMP` to add support for many complex modeling objects which 
include:
- Infinite parameters (e.g., time, space, uncertainty, etc.)
- Finite parameters (similar to `ParameterJuMP`)
- Infinite variables (e.g., ``y(t, x)``)
- Derivatives (e.g., ``\frac{\partial y(t, x)}{\partial t}``)
- Measures (e.g., ``\int_{t \in \mathcal{D}_t}y(t,x) dt``, ``\mathbb{E}[y(\xi)]``)
- More

!!! note 
    `InfiniteOpt` is intended to be used for infinite-dimensional optimization 
    problems. Finite problems (e.g., directly modeling a discrete time model) 
    should instead be modeled using [`JuMP`](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/).

Moreover, `InfiniteOpt` decouples the infinite-dimensional formulations from the 
finite transformations typically used to solve them. This readily enables diverse 
techniques be used to solve these types of problems. By default, we employ 
direct transcription (i.e., discretization) transformations whose features 
include:
- Efficient implementations that scale **linearly**!
- Diverse integral approximations (e.g., quadratures, sampling)
- Diverse derivative approximations (e.g., finite difference, orthogonal 
  collocation)
- Sophisticated support point management system
- Compatible with all [JuMP-supported solvers](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/v0.21.8/installation/#Supported-solvers)

Accepted infinite/finite problem forms currently include:
- Variables
    - Continuous and semi-continuous
    - Binary
    - Integer and semi-integer
    - Semi-definite
- Derivatives
    - Ordinary derivative operators (of any order)
    - Partial derivative operators (of any order)
- Measures
    - Univariate and multivariate integrals 
    - Univariate and multivariate expectations 
    - Arbitrary measure operators (via general measure API)
- Objectives
    - Linear
    - Quadratic (convex and non-convex)
    - Higher-order powers (via place holder variables)
- Constraints
    - Linear
    - Quadratic (convex and non-convex)
    - Higher-order powers (via place holder variables)
    - Conic
    - Semi-definite
    - Indicator

!!! note 
    Nonlinear objects as defined by `JuMP.@NL[macro_name]` are not currently 
    supported by `InfiniteOpt`. See [Nonlinear Expressions](@ref) for more 
    information and possible workarounds. 

### Modeling Infinite-Dimensional Problems with InfiniteOpt.jl
See our YouTube overview of infinite-dimensional programming and InfiniteOpt.jl's

## Installation
`InfiniteOpt.jl` is a registered `Julia` package and can be added simply by 
inputting the following in the package manager:
```julia
(v1.6) pkg> add InfiniteOpt
```
Please visit our [Installation Guide](@ref) for more details and information
on how to get started.

## First Steps 
`InfiniteOpt` is extension of `JuMP`, thus new users should start by 
familiarizing themselves with how to use `JuMP` first. See 
[`JuMP`'s documentation](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/v0.21.8/) to learn more.

Once you're familiar with `JuMP` check out our [Quick Start Guide](@ref) to get 
started. From there we provide extensive documentation to help you along, please 
see [How to Use the Documentation](@ref) for more info.

## How to Use the Documentation
`InfiniteOpt` is intended to serve both as a high-level interface for 
infinite-dimensional optimization and as a highly customizable/extendable 
platform for implementing advanced techniques. With this in mind, we provide the 
`User Guide` sections to walk through the ins and outs of `InfiniteOpt`. Each 
page in the `User Guide` typically contains the following:
- An `Overview` section describing the purpose of the page.
- A `Basic Usage` section to guide using `InfiniteOpt` at a high level.
- Other sections offering more in-depth information/guidance beyond basic usage.

We also provide a technical manual in the `API Manual` sections which are 
comprised of the docstrings of all the public methods and types that comprise 
`InfiniteOpt`. These detail the technical aspects of each function, method, macro, 
and composite type.

Details, instructions, templates, and tutorials on how to write user-defined 
extensions in `InfiniteOpt` are provided on the [Extensions](@ref) page.

Finally, case study examples are provided in the `Examples` sections.

## Contribution
`InfiniteOpt` is a powerful tool with a broad scope lending to a large realm of 
possible feature additions and enhancements. So, we are thrilled to support 
anyone who would like to contribute to this project in any way big or small.
