# # Pandemic Control
# A stochastic optimal control problem were we seek to control the spread of a 
# contagion with uncertain parameters.

# ## Problem Statement and Model
# We wish to determine optimal social distancing policy to control spread of a 
# contagion and minimize the economic impact of doing so. We'll model the spread 
# of the virus through a given population using the SEIR Model which considers 4 
# population subsets that follow:
# ```math 
# \text{Susceptible} \rightarrow \text{Exposed} \rightarrow \text{Infectious} \rightarrow \text{Recovered}
# ```
# This model is formalized as:
# ```math 
# \begin{gathered}
# \frac{ds(t)}{dt} = (u(t) - 1)\beta si(t) \\
# \frac{de(t)}{dt} = (1 - u(t))\beta si(t) - \xi e(t) \\
# \frac{di(t)}{dt} = \xi e(t) - \gamma i(t)\\
# \frac{dr(t)}{dt} = \gamma i(t) \\
# si(t) = s(t) i(t)
# \end{gathered}
# ```
# where ``s(t)`` is the susceptible population, ``e(t)`` is the exposed population, 
# ``i(t)`` is the infectious population, ``r(t)`` is the recovered population, 
# and ``u(t) \in [0, 1]`` is the enforced population isolation (social distancing). 
# The other values denote model parameters that will be specific to the contagion 
# in question. 

# For our case study, we'll consider the incubation constant ``\xi`` to be an 
# uncertain parameter ``\xi \sim \mathcal{U}(\underline{\xi}, \overline{\xi})``. 
# This introduces to infinite dependencies into our model: time ``t`` and 
# uncertain incubation ``\xi``. Moreover we'll seek to minimize the isolation 
# measures ``u(t)`` that are implemented while limiting the amount of infected 
# individuals ``i(t)`` to be below a threshold ``i_{max}``. Thus, the optimization 
# problem becomes:
# ```math 
# \begin{aligned}
# &&\min_{} &&& \int_{t \in \mathcal{D}_{t}} u(t) dt \\
# && \text{s.t.} &&& \frac{\partial s(t, \xi)}{\partial t} = (u(t) - 1)\beta si(t, \xi), && \forall t \in \mathcal{D}_{t}, \xi \in \mathcal{D}_{\xi} \\
# &&&&& \frac{\partial e(t, \xi)}{\partial t} = (1 - u(t))\beta si(t, \xi) - \xi e(t, \xi), && \forall t \in \mathcal{D}_{t}, \xi \in \mathcal{D}_{\xi} \\
# &&&&& \frac{\partial i(t, \xi)}{\partial t} = \xi e(t, \xi) - \gamma i(t, \xi), && \forall t \in \mathcal{D}_{t}, \xi \in \mathcal{D}_{\xi} \\
# &&&&& \frac{\partial r(t, \xi)}{\partial t} = \gamma i(t, \xi), && \forall t \in \mathcal{D}_{t}, \xi \in \mathcal{D}_{\xi} \\
# &&&&& si(t, \xi) = s(t, \xi) i(t, \xi), && \forall \forall t \in \mathcal{D}_{t}, \xi \in \mathcal{D}_{\xi} \\
# &&&&& s(0, \xi) = s_0, e(0, \xi) = e_0, i(0, \xi) = i_0, r(0, \xi) = r_0, && \forall \xi \in \mathcal{D}_{\xi} \\
# &&&&& i(t, \xi) \leq i_{max}, && \forall t \in \mathcal{D}_{t}, \xi \in \mathcal{D}_{\xi} \\
# &&&&& u(t) \in [0, 0.8] \\
# &&&&& \xi \sim \mathcal{U}(\underline{\xi}, \overline{\xi})
# \end{aligned}
# ```
# Notice that the SEIR model variables now all depend on both ``t`` and ``\xi``, 
# except ``u(t)`` which means we need to decide our policy before knowing the 
# true value of ``\xi``.

# ## Modeling in InfiniteOpt
# Traditional modeling frameworks like JuMP cannot be used to solve this model 
# directly because it is infinite, contains partial difference equations, and 
# contains a time expectation. We would first have to transform it into a 
# transcripted (discretized) variant by applying all the necessary techniques 
# (e.g., orthogonal collocation over finite elements, trapezoid rule, etc.) 
# which is very combersome and nontrivial in this case. 

# However, we can directly model the above form in InfiniteOpt and it will take 
# care of the rest! Let's get started by importing the needed packages and 
# specifying the model parameters that we'll need.

## Set the SEIR parameters
γ = 0.303
β = 0.727
N = 1e5
ξ_min = 0.1 
ξ_max = 0.6

## Set the domain information
i_max = 0.02
ϵ = 0.005
t0 = 0
tf = 200
extra_ts = [0.001, 0.002, 0.004, 0.008, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8]
num_samples = 5

## Set the intial condition values
e0 = 1 / N
i0 = 0
r0 = 0
s0 = 1 - 1 / N;

# ## Model Initialization
# Now let's setup our infinite model and select Ipopt as our optimizer that will 
# be used to solve it. This is accomplished making an [`InfiniteModel`](@ref):
model = InfiniteModel(Ipopt.Optimizer);

# ## Infinite Parameter Definition
# We now need to define the infinite parameters ``t \in [t_0, t_f]`` and 
# ``\xi \sim \mathcal{U}(\underline{\xi}, \overline{\xi})``. This is accomplished 
# with [`@infinite_parameter`](@ref). We'll also include the following 
# specifications:
# - use 51 equidistant time points
# - specify that orgothonal collocation using 2 nodes should be used for time derivatives
# - specify that the number of random scenarios should equal `num_samples`
# - add `extra_ts` as extra time points
@infinite_parameter(model, t ∈ [t0, tf], num_supports = 51, 
                    derivative_method = OrthogonalCollocation(2))
@infinite_parameter(model, ξ ~ Uniform(ξ_min, ξ_max), num_supports = num_samples)
add_supports(t, extra_ts)

# ## Infinite Variable Definition
# With our infinite parameters defined, we can now define our infinite variables:
# - ``s(t, \xi) \geq 0``
# - ``e(t, \xi) \geq 0``
# - ``i(t, \xi) \geq 0``
# - ``r(t, \xi) \geq 0``
# - ``si(t, \xi)``
# - ``0 \leq u(t) \leq 0.8``
@variable(model, s ≥ 0, Infinite(t, ξ))
@variable(model, e ≥ 0, Infinite(t, ξ))
@variable(model, i ≥ 0, Infinite(t, ξ))
@variable(model, r ≥ 0, Infinite(t, ξ))
@variable(model, si, Infinite(t, ξ))
@variable(model, 0 ≤ u ≤ 0.8, Infinite(t), start = 0.2)

# ## Objective Definition
# Now its time to add the objective 
# ``\min \ \int_{t \in \mathcal{D}_{t}} u(t) dt`` using `@objective`:
@objective(model, Min, ∫(u, t))

# ## Constraint Definition
# The last step now to defining our model is to define the constraints using 
# `@constraint`. This will involve defining the initial conditions:
# ```math 
# s(0, \xi) = s_0, e(0, \xi) = e_0, i(0, \xi) = i_0, r(0, \xi) = r_0, \ \forall \xi \in \mathcal{D}_{\xi}
# ```
# the model equations:
# ```math 
# \begin{aligned}
# &&& \frac{\partial s(t, \xi)}{\partial t} = (u(t) - 1)\beta si(t, \xi), && \forall t \in \mathcal{D}_{t}, \xi \in \mathcal{D}_{\xi} \\
# &&& \frac{\partial e(t, \xi)}{\partial t} = (1 - u(t))\beta si(t, \xi) - \xi e(t, \xi), && \forall t \in \mathcal{D}_{t}, \xi \in \mathcal{D}_{\xi} \\
# &&& \frac{\partial i(t, \xi)}{\partial t} = \xi e(t, \xi) - \gamma i(t, \xi), && \forall t \in \mathcal{D}_{t}, \xi \in \mathcal{D}_{\xi} \\
# &&& \frac{\partial r(t, \xi)}{\partial t} = \gamma i(t, \xi), && \forall t \in \mathcal{D}_{t}, \xi \in \mathcal{D}_{\xi} \\
# &&& si(t, \xi) = s(t, \xi) i(t, \xi), && \forall \forall t \in \mathcal{D}_{t}, \xi \in \mathcal{D}_{\xi}, \\
# \end{aligned}
# ```
# and the infection limit constraint:
# ```math 
# i(t, \xi) \leq i_{max}, \ \forall t \in \mathcal{D}_t, \xi \in \mathcal{D}_{\xi}.
# ```
## Define the initial conditions
@constraint(model, s(0, ξ) == s0)
@constraint(model, e(0, ξ) == e0)
@constraint(model, i(0, ξ) == i0)
@constraint(model, r(0, ξ) == r0)

## Define the SEIR equations
@constraint(model, s_constr, ∂(s, t) == -(1 - u) * β * si)
@constraint(model, e_constr, ∂(e, t) == (1 - u) * β * si - ξ * e)
@constraint(model, i_constr, ∂(i, t) == ξ * e - γ * i)
@constraint(model, r_constr, ∂(r, t) == γ * i)
@constraint(model, si == s * i)

## Define the infection rate limit
@constraint(model, imax_constr, i ≤ i_max)

# ## Display the Infinite Model
# Let's display `model` now that it is fully defined:
print(model)

# ## Optimize the Model
# Let's solve our model and find the optimal policy. All we have to do is 
# invoke `optimize!` and the model will automatically be transformed solved behind 
# the scenes:
optimize!(model)

# ## Retrieve and Plot the Results
# Now we can retrieve the optimal results and plot them to visualize the optimal 
# policy. Note that the values of infinite variables will be returned as arrays 
# corresponding to how the supports were used to discretize our model. We can 
# retrieve our values using `value`.

# Get the results:
