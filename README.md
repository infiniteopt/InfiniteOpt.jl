A `JuMP` extension for expressing and solving infinite-dimensional optimization
problems. Such areas include [stochastic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_programming),
[dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming),
space-time optimization, and more. `InfiniteOpt` serves as an easy-to-use modeling
interface for these advanced problem types that can be used by those with little
to no background in these areas. It also it contains a wealth of capabilities
making it a powerful and convenient tool for advanced users.

It builds upon `JuMP` to add support for many complex modeling objects which 
include:
- Infinite parameters (e.g., time, space, uncertainty, etc.)
- Finite parameters (similar to `ParameterJuMP`)
- Infinite variables (decision functions) (e.g., `y(t, x)`)
- Derivatives (e.g., `∂y(t, x)/∂t`)
- Measures (e.g., `∫y(t,x)dt`, `𝔼[y(ξ)]`)

The unifying modeling abstraction behind `InfiniteOpt` captures a wide spectrum 
of disciplines which include dynamic, PDE, stochastic, and semi-infinite 
optimization. Moreover, we facilitate transferring techniques between these 
to synthesize new optimization paradigms!
